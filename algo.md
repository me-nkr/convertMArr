# Working explanation for convertMArr().

convertMArr() is a recursive function that is repeated for the number of arrays in a multidimentional array. It goes as deep as the how deep the multidimentional array is and "stringifies" every array.

## Input :

You pass in a multidimentional array as argument to function.

## Steps :
 
1. is_SorA() function checks if every element of 1st dimension array is either string/array. exits the function if false and returs the string "Invalid Array".
 
2. if is_SorA() return true, array enters a infinite loop which will be exited when parent function (convertMArr) returns its result.
 
3. is_every() function with type parameter set as string checks if weather all element in the array (1st dimension) is sring or not.
 
4. if is_every() returns true, array is conveted into string using stringifyArr() function. and returns the string as result of parent function.
 
5. if is\_every() returns false, array is passed into a foreach loop where it runs is_array() function on each element of array.
 
6.0.1 if is_array() retuns false a if (elseif) statement checks wether the current element is the first (0th) element of array or not, if the statement returns true loop continues by skipping next lines.
 
6.0.2. if its not the first element of array a variable named str ($str) is appended with "( ", current element of array, and " )". 
 
6.1.1 if is_array() returns true, a variable str ($str) is appended with result of convertMArr() function on current element of array (convertMArr("current element of array")), which is wrapped by "( " and " )".
 
6.1.1.1 if elements of array(current element) is arrays convertMArr() is applied of those too. it will run untill nth dimension and convert arrays into strings.
 
7. $str is appended with the 0th element of array. (specefic for this function usage, can be ommited if not necessary)
 
8. rtrim() function is used to trim out the "0th element of array" from the end of $str, because "0th element of array" is appended one extra time to $str. (again, specefic for this function usage, can be ommited if not necessary)
 
9. $str is returned as the result of convertMArr() function after every dimension of array is converted into string. and the infinite while loop is exited as the function is over.

## Output :

Function return a string that is "stringified" according to the algorithm in stringifyArr() function
